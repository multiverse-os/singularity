## Multiverse: `memfd` Library
**URL** [multiverse-os.org](https://multiverse-os.org)

#### Introduction
A simple interface for storing file descriptors (FDs) in memory, specifically
being developed as a subcomponent of the Multiverse OS [singularity
library](https://github.com/multiverse-os/singularity) which leverages memory
file descriptors to work with executable binary data exclusively in memory.
